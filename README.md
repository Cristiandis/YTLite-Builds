## How to build a YouTube Plus app by yourself using Github actions

If this is your first time here, start from step 1. If you built a YouTube Plus app before, skip steps 1 and 2. Instead, click on the "Sync fork" button to get the latest version of the tweak and continue through step 3.

1. Fork this repository using the fork button on the top right.
2. On your forked repository, go to **Repository Settings** > **Actions**, enable **Read and Write** permissions.
3. Navigate to the **Actions tab** on your forked repository. Select the desired workflow from the list on the left:
   - **Create YouTube Plus app** to build the YouTube Plus-only app.
   - **YouTube Plus + YouPiP, YTUHD and RYD** to build the YouTube Plus app with YouPiP, YTUHD, and Return YouTube Dislikes.
4. Click **Run workflow** button located on the right side.
5. Prepare a decrypted .ipa file (we cannot provide you this due to legal reasons) and upload it to a file provider (filebin.net or Dropbox is recommended). Paste the url to the necessary field.
6. Type tweak version from releases (by default selected latest release) and click **Run workflow**.
7. Wait for the build to finish. You can download the YouTube Plus app from the releases section of your forked repo. (If you can't find the releases section, go to your forked repo and add /releases to the url. i.e github.com/user/YTLite/releases)
